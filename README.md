# Hi folks! 👋

I'm Iván, a software engineer from the north of Spain interested in all kinds of technologies. 

With years of experience developing projects of all kinds with Ruby and Rails, I'm currently focused on Elixir and Phoenix Framework, working full-remote.  

Diversity in the tech industry is very important to me, as well as mental health awareness, and accessibility. Always trying to do my best.

When I'm not working, I like to learn new technologies, write about software development, organize meetups and conferences about software development, mentor new developers, take some photographs, and play the guitar.
