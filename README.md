I'm Iván, a Software Engineer from the north of Spain interested in all kinds of technologies. I've been working as a software engineer since 2005, starting to develop desktop applications to quickly focus on my true passion: web development.

With years of experience working with Ruby, Rails, Elixir, and Phoenix Framework, right now I'm focused on my transition to become a T-Shaped developer: keep making my backend expertise strong while I improve my knowledge of other areas such as frontend, devops, mobile dev, and UI/UX. Working full-remote.

Diversity in the tech industry is very important to me, as well as mental health awareness, and accessibility. Always trying to do my best.

When I'm not working, I like to learn new technologies, write about software development, organize meetups and conferences about software development, mentor new developers, take some photographs, and play the guitar.
